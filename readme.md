## Developer's Best Friend

This solution provides tools to help a developer generate dummy data in support of the application development process. A [Lorem Ipsum Text Generator](http://p3.davidisadorelieberman.com/lorem) provides a passage of up to ninety-nine paragraphs of slightly randomized Lorem Ipsum text. A [Random User Generator](http://p3.davidisadorelieberman.com/users) allows the developer to create up to ninety-nine random users, supporting the generation of lists consisting entirely of female users, entirely of male users, or a randomized mix of male and female users. This feature also makes use of the **phootwork\\collection** php library to support two-factor alphabetical sorting of the generated users by way of an anonymous comparator function.
